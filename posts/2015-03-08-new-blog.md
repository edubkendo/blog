# Welcome to My New Blog

Hello and welcome. I've written this blog the hard way, using [Elixir](http://www.elixir-lang.org) and [Phoenix](http://www.phoenixframework.org/v0.10.0/docs/templates) to create a blogging platform from scratch. There is certainly no need to do such a thing in this day and age, when we have a plethora of easy options like Wordpress, Ghost and Medium. But this seemed liked the easiest possible thing I could write with Phoenix to learn it's nuts and bolts, beyond the simple hello world stuff I'd already done.

Because I've made this blog really simple to add posts to (it's just a matter of typing up some markdown, and pushing the commit) I hope I'll actually keep this blog current. We'll see. The plan is to walk you through what it took to get this blog up and running over the next few posts. I'll probably skip over some of the details, so if I leave something out that you were curious about, feel free to ask.
